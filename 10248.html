简介




Geared is a unique and addictive puzzle game that will test your creative thinking and problem-solving skills. With its elegant design and challenging gameplay, Geared is sure to keep you engaged for hours on end.
In Geared, your objective is simple - to connect gears in a way that allows them all to turn when you start the mechanism. The catch is that you have limited gears and space, so you'll need to strategically place them to create the perfect gear system.
The game features over 200 carefully crafted levels, each with its own set of challenges and obstacles. As you progress, the puzzles become more complex and require a combination of logical thinking and experimentation to solve.
What sets Geared apart is its intuitive and user-friendly interface. Simply drag and drop gears onto the level to connect them, and tap the start button to see if your design works. If not, you can easily undo your moves and try again, making it a game that anyone can pick up and play.
Geared also offers a time trial mode, where you can test your skills against the clock and compete for high scores. Challenge your friends and see who can solve the puzzles in the fastest time!
With its addictive gameplay, stunning visuals, and challenging puzzles, Geared is a must-have for puzzle enthusiasts and casual gamers alike. Download it now and start unraveling the gears!
